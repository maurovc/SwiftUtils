# SwiftUtils
I'll be updating this repo with Utils classes (image treatment, device information, etc.) created in Swift

## Device Utils
This class provides functions that deal with the device and simplifies the calls.

## Image Utils
This class provides functions that treat images (scale, mask, crop, QR creation, etc.).
